A simple rails app that allows you to upload an image and see it on google maps with panning and zoom.

All of the processing is done in the foreground. 

Models:
image - 'Saving' the image tiles it and saves the tiles to public/data/tiles.

Views:
upload/upload.html.erb - Pick an image to upload.
viewmap.html.erb - See the map. Right now, this simply displays the tiles in public/data/tiles.

Controllers:
upload - Uploads the image, then displays the map.
